#![Logo](data/icon/segreto_icon48.png) Segreto 3
A simple app for saving your ideas/ personal data secretely on your computer. It uses AES256 encryption to save your idea file locally, making it virtually impossible for any one to read your ideas/personal data, unless it's you or others know your password.

Flat theme inspired by [Flat UI](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/)
